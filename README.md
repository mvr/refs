mvr's bibfiles
==============

* `types.bib`: type theory
* `optics.bib`: optics/lenses
* `life.bib`: Conway's Game of Life
* `kenzo.bib`: Effective Algebraic Topology

Managed using [Jon Sterling's
scripts](https://github.com/jonsterling/bibtex-references) (thanks!),
with Makefile tricks to handle multiple bibfiles.
